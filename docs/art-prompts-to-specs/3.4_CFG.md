## Lesson 3 – Exercise 4 (Slow Version)
### Attention Weighting + CFG (for Stable Diffusion)

> Note: These knobs are **Stable Diffusion-focused**.  
> DALL·E generally does not expose true attention weights or CFG.

---

### What is CFG?
**CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance)** = how strictly the model follows your prompt.

- **Low CFG** → more freedom, more variation, sometimes softer/cleaner.
- **High CFG** → more literal to your words, but higher risk of “overcooked” artifacts.

---

### What is attention weighting?
Attention weighting tells SD:
**“This word matters more.”**

Examples:
- `(owl:1.0)` = normal importance  
- `(owl:1.2)` = slightly more important  
- `(owl:1.4)` = strongly emphasized  
- `(owl:1.6)` = very strong emphasis  

---

### Why do they interact?
Both increase “prompt pressure”:

- **Weighting** pushes **one word** harder.
- **CFG** pushes the **entire prompt** harder.

So if both are high, the image can feel forced or break.

---

### The simplest way to run the exercise

#### Step 1 — Fix CFG
Pick one CFG and keep it constant (e.g., **CFG 8**).

#### Step 2 — Run a weighting ladder
Generate four images with only this changed:

- `(owl:1.0)`
- `(owl:1.2)`
- `(owl:1.4)`
- `(owl:1.6)`

Everything else stays identical.

#### Step 3 — Find the “too far” point
You’ll usually see:
- clarity improves as you increase weight  
- then at some point **artifacts appear**

#### Step 4 — Step back one notch
If:
- `1.6` looks weird  
- but `1.4` looks great  

Then:
- **lock `1.4`** as your default.

---

### Optional Step 5 — Light CFG adjustment
If your best weight still feels slightly forced:

Try lowering CFG by one step:

- `CFG 8 → 7`  
- or `CFG 8 → 6`

Pick the cleaner result.

---

### Ultra-simple rule
**Increase weight until the first artifacts appear.  
Then step back one notch.  
Lower CFG slightly only if needed.**

---

### DALL·E translation (same idea, no numbers)
Use wording emphasis instead of weights:

- “a geometric owl archivist…”  
- “the owl is the clear main subject…”  
- “the owl is dominant in frame…”

Same test mindset:
**change one emphasis variable at a time.**

## For SD

(owl:1.0)
(owl:1.2)
(owl:1.4)
(owl:1.6)


[COMPOSITION] centered hero subject, mid-shot, clean poster layout with generous margins
[SUBJECT] (owl:1.6) archivist with layered wing panels, front-facing, holding a luminous data-crystal at the sternum
[BACKGROUND] quiet library-constellation grid, soft circular framing rings, minimal sacred geometry accents
[STYLE] Utala visual style — sacred geometry + sci-fi minimalism, perfect symmetry, fine etched lines, matte graphite texture, luminous engraving
[LIGHTING] diffuse glow with subtle rim light, no harsh specular highlights
[COLOR] limited 3–5 color system, high value separation, accents reserved for the data-crystal
[VALUE DESIGN] data-crystal is the brightest element; owl body/head read as the darkest coherent mass; background glyphs and rings remain mid-tones and low contrast
[TEXTURE] matte graphite with subtle brushed-metal hints, minimal grain, no noisy micro-texture
[MOOD] calm power, sacred technology, quiet intelligence, archival serenity
[NEGATIVE] no text, no logos, no watermark, no signatures; no extra limbs or duplicated heads; no malformed anatomy; no mushy edges; no noisy micro-detail; no busy background; maintain clean silhouette and strong grayscale readability
[OUTPUT] poster ratio, high clarity, crisp edges, print-friendly, strong readability in grayscale


// Run ladder: change only (owl:1.0 → 1.6)
// If artifacts rise, lower CFG slightly.

## For Dalle

DALL·E-friendly “attention ladder” for your owl. Same idea as 1.0 → 1.6, just expressed in wording (since DALL·E doesn’t use SD-style weights or CFG). DALL·E 3’s main exposed controls are things like size plus optional style (vivid/natural) and quality (standard/hd), not CFG.

### A) Emphasis 1.0 (neutral)

[COMPOSITION] centered hero subject, mid-shot, clean poster layout with generous margins
[SUBJECT] geometric owl archivist with layered wing panels and fine etched contour lines, front-facing, holding a small luminous data-crystal at the sternum
[BACKGROUND] quiet library-constellation grid, soft circular framing rings, minimal sacred geometry accents
[STYLE] Utala visual style — sacred geometry + sci-fi minimalism, perfect symmetry, fine etched lines, matte graphite texture, luminous engraving
[LIGHTING] diffuse glow with subtle rim light, no harsh specular highlights
[COLOR] limited 3–5 color system, high value separation, accents reserved for the data-crystal
[VALUE DESIGN] data-crystal is the brightest element; owl body/head read as the darkest coherent mass; background glyphs and rings remain mid-tones and low contrast

### B) Emphasis 1.2 (light priority)
