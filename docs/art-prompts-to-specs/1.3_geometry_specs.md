[COMPOSITION] medium shot, cassowary centered in the frame, shown from chest up, head and neck filling about 35% of the canvas height, dense rainforest foliage softly blurred in the background, subtle depth with lighter tones in the distance

[SUBJECT] wild cassowary standing on the forest floor in a humid tropical rainforest, surrounded by ferns, broad-leaf plants, and scattered fallen leaves

[STYLE] hyperrealistic wildlife illustration, natural proportions, detailed feathers and casque, cinematic framing

[COLOR] rich deep greens and cool teals for the foliage, muted earthy browns on the forest floor, subtle iridescent blues and reds on the cassowary

[TEXTURE] detailed feather texture, damp bark and leaf surfaces, slight atmospheric haze between foreground and background

[LIGHTING] soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the canopy, gentle dappled light on the cassowary, slight bloom where light catches wet leaves

[MOOD] quiet, immersive, slightly tense but peaceful, feeling of being deep in untouched jungle

[DETAILS] fine detail on the cassowary’s eye and casque, small insects or tiny floating dust motes in the shafts of light, no visible human structures or trails

[OUTPUT] high-resolution illustration, 4:5 vertical aspect ratio, poster-print ready

[COMPOSITION] cassowary small in the frame, positioned in the lower-left corner, full body taking up about 15% of the canvas height, towering tree trunks and dense foliage filling the upper two thirds of the image, emphasizing the scale and height of the forest

[COMPOSITION] dramatic low-angle view from near ground level, cassowary in the foreground with its legs and lower body dominating the bottom half of the frame, head and casque rising into the upper half, nearly reaching the top edge, background trees compressed into the upper third to enhance the towering presence

[COMPOSITION] top-down view from high above, looking straight down onto a small forest clearing; the cassowary is tiny, near the center of the frame, occupying about 10% of the canvas height, surrounded on all sides by overlapping treetops and foliage that fill the rest of the image, forming a natural circular vignette

[COMPOSITION] cassowary in side view walking along a narrow forest path, body placed on the left vertical third line of the canvas, taking up about 25% of the image height; the path starts at the bottom center and curves gently into the midground, guiding the eye, with dense vegetation framing the right side and upper edges
