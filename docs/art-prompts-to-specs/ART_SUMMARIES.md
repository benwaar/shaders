## Phase 1–2 Recap (Cheatsheet)

- **Lesson 1 (Phase 1 foundations)**  
  - Learned to think in **modules**: COMPOSITION, SUBJECT, STYLE, COLOR, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, MOOD, OUTPUT.  
  - Discovered which knobs are **structural** (composition, value, color) vs **soft** (style, mood, texture, lighting).  
  - Practised changing **one block at a time** to see clean cause/effect.

- **Lesson 2 (Phase 2 – style & surface)**  
  - Explored **style eras** (’70s, Bauhaus, Y2K) as “world filters” on the same cassowary.  
  - Used **TEXTURE %** to change object age (clean vs distressed) without changing design.  
  - Designed explicit **[VALUE DESIGN]** hierarchies and tested in grayscale thumbnails.  
  - Ran **lighting-only sweeps** (north-light, clamshell, hard noon, overcast) to understand edges & shadow shapes.  
  - Compared **warm vs cool limited palettes** to see how temperature affects mood and silhouette sharpness.

Core takeaway so far:  
> Lock **SUBJECT + COMPOSITION + VALUE DESIGN** first → then play with **STYLE, MOOD, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, COLOR** as separate knobs.

## Value in Art (Tonal Value)

### What Is Value in Art?

Value in art, also known as **tonal value**, refers to the **lightness or darkness** of a color or shade, independent of the hue. It is a fundamental element of art used to create **contrast, depth, form, and a focal point** by depicting how light hits objects, creating highlights and shadows. 

Artists often use **value scales** (like a grayscale, with light tints and dark shades) to manipulate these qualities and achieve specific visual effects.

---

### How Artists Use Value

- **To create contrast**  
  The human eye is drawn to strong contrasts between light and dark areas. Artists use this to make a **focal point** stand out.

- **To create depth and form**  
  By using **gradations of value**, artists can create the illusion of **three-dimensional space** and roundness on a two-dimensional surface.

- **To define shapes**  
  Value helps define the shapes of objects and can separate them from one another or from the background.

- **To create mood and atmosphere**  
  The overall range of values in a piece can affect its mood:  
  - A **narrow range** of values can feel calm or harmonious.  
  - A **wide range** of values can create drama, tension, or high energy.

---

### Techniques for Creating Value

- **In drawings**  
  Artists use shading techniques such as:
  - **Hatching**
  - **Cross-hatching**
  - **Stippling**
  - **Blending**  
  to create a range of values with a single medium like pencil, charcoal, or pen.

- **In painting**  
  Value is created by:
  - Mixing a color with **white** to create a **tint** (lighter value).
  - Mixing a color with **black** to create a **shade** (darker value).

- **In monochromatic art**  
  Artists use variations of a **single color**, from its darkest shade to its lightest tint, to create value and dimension. This can be seen in a **monochromatic scale**, where one hue carries the full value range.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Value scale**  
  A tool that shows a range of values from **black to white**, with various shades of gray in between. It helps artists understand and compare light and dark relationships.

- **Tint**  
  A color that has had **white added** to it to make it **lighter**.

- **Shade**  
  A color that has had **black added** to it to make it **darker**.

- **Tone**  
  A color that has had **gray added** to it, which can **soften or dim** the original color.

---

## Color & Palette Design

Color is not just “prettiness”; it’s a structural tool that can change how readable, emotional, and “styled” an image feels even when everything else stays the same.

### What Color Does

With **COMPOSITION, SUBJECT, STYLE, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, MOOD** held constant, changing only the **[COLOR]** block can:

- Shift **readability**  
  - High value contrast → clear subject/background separation.  
  - Low value contrast → softer, more blended read.

- Change **mood**  
  - Warm palettes (reds, oranges, yellows) → cozy, energetic, nostalgic.  
  - Cool palettes (blues, greens) → calm, distant, eerie, techy.

- Suggest **style/genre**  
  - Muted, sun-faded → retro/vintage.  
  - Primaries → graphic/Bauhaus/designy.  
  - Neon + complementary hits → Y2K / cyber / nightlife.

### Palette Discipline

- Aim for **3–5 key colors** in most designs.
- Name them or define them clearly (e.g., “burnt orange, mustard, faded teal, off-white”).
- Decide:
  - Which colors belong to the **subject**.
  - Which belong to the **background / supporting shapes**.
  - Which (if any) are reserved for **accents / focal points**.

### Practical Habits

- Treat **COLOR as its own experimental layer**:
  - Duplicate the prompt.
  - Change only [COLOR].
  - Compare A/B/C variants.

- Always do a **grayscale check**:
  - If two palettes look equally good in color, choose the one with better **value separation** in black and white.

---

## Composition & Framing

Composition is how you arrange things in the frame – it decides **what the picture feels like it’s about**, even when the subject and style stay the same.

With **SUBJECT, STYLE, COLOR, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, MOOD** held constant, changing only **[COMPOSITION]** can:

- Make the subject feel **powerful or small** (scale).
- Change the **psychology** (intimate vs distant, calm vs tense).
- Shift the **story moment** (quiet encounter vs epic reveal vs surveillance shot).

Think of composition as your main **“story knob”**.

---

### Camera Distance (Close / Medium / Wide)

How close the “camera” is to the subject changes the story:

- **Close-up**  
  - Fills much of the frame.  
  - Feels intimate, intense, focused on expression or detail.  
  - Good for: faces, key symbols, objects that must read clearly.

- **Medium shot**  
  - Shows subject plus a bit of context (e.g., torso + some environment).  
  - Feels like a conversation distance, balanced between character and setting.  
  - Good default: portraits, character-focused scenes.

- **Wide shot**  
  - Subject is smaller; environment dominates.  
  - Feels cinematic, epic, or isolating (tiny figure in big world).  
  - Good for: showing scale, mood of environment, “journey” vibes.

---

### Camera Angle (Eye-Level / Low / High / Top-Down)

The vertical angle carries a lot of psychology:

- **Eye-level**  
  - Neutral, honest, conversational.  
  - Subject feels like an equal.

- **Low angle (looking up)**  
  - Subject feels bigger, powerful, imposing, sometimes heroic or threatening.

- **High angle (looking down)**  
  - Subject feels smaller, vulnerable, observed, or less powerful.

- **Top-down / overhead**  
  - Detached, strategic, or documentary (like a map or surveillance camera).  
  - Great for showing patterns and layout.

---

### Rule of Thirds (Quick Version)

The **rule of thirds** is a simple placement guideline that avoids stiff centering.

- Imagine a **3×3 grid** over your image:
  - Two vertical lines, two horizontal lines.
- The most “charged” spots are:
  - The four **intersection points**.
  - The horizontal lines (often used for horizons).
  - The vertical lines (often used for subject placement).

Uses:

- Place the **subject’s head or main focal point** on a grid intersection.
- Put the **horizon** on the top or bottom third, not dead center.
- Place the subject on a **left or right third**, leaving space for:
  - Environment,
  - Implied motion,
  - Or something they’re looking at.

**Centered vs thirds:**

- **Centered** → stable, iconic, symmetrical, confrontational, or calm.  
- **Thirds** → more dynamic, cinematic, and “designed”.

It’s not a law, just a reliable starting point. Learn it, then break it on purpose.

---

### Foreground, Midground, Background

Splitting the scene into layers adds **depth** and **focus**:

- **Foreground**  
  - Elements closest to the viewer (branches, rocks, railings, shadows).  
  - Can be used to **frame** the subject and create a “peeking in” feeling.

- **Midground**  
  - Usually where the **main subject** lives.  
  - Needs the clearest shapes and values.

- **Background**  
  - Environment and big shapes behind everything.  
  - Should support, not compete – softer edges, simpler shapes, less contrast.

Simple rule:
- Foreground = framing & depth  
- Midground = story  
- Background = mood & context

---

### Simple Geometry & Ratios

You can make compositions more **consistent and repeatable** by using simple numeric ratios instead of “vibes” only:

- **Subject height**  
  - Example: “cassowary is about **¼–⅓ of the canvas height**.”  
  - This helps keep its presence consistent across multiple images.

- **Horizon placement**  
  - Example: horizon locked to the **top or bottom third** of the frame.  
  - This keeps your skies/grounds consistent and echoes the **rule of thirds**.

- **Spacing & margins**  
  - Example: “keep at least one **head-height margin** above the subject,” or “poster has **even margins** on all sides.”

These little geometry rules turn composition into something you can **reproduce on purpose** instead of rediscovering from scratch every time.

---

### Composition as a Shot List (Same Subject, New Story)

You can explore composition systematically by making a **shot list** for the same subject:

- **Centered, medium shot, eye-level**  
  - Neutral portrait / “default” view.

- **Wide shot, subject small on lower third, big sky**  
  - Tiny, lonely, reflective, environmental mood.

- **Low-angle, medium shot, subject on right third**  
  - Powerful, heroic, looming.

- **Top-down, subject near center or intersection**  
  - Map-like, strategic, analytical.

- **Side view, subject walking into frame from left or right**  
  - Journey, motion, direction.

Each one can use **the same cassowary, same style, same colors** – composition alone makes it feel like a different moment in the story.

---

## Focal Point & Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is about **who wins** in the frame. The focal point is the area the eye goes to first, on purpose.

### One Area Wins

- A strong image usually has **one clear winner**:
  - The spot with the highest contrast, most detail, or strongest color.
- Everything else is designed to **support** that winner:
  - Slightly softer, less detailed, or less contrasted.

### Tools for Controlling the Focal Point

- **Contrast**  
  - Place the darkest dark against the lightest light at the focal point.

- **Isolation**  
  - Give the focal area breathing room; don’t crowd it with similar shapes.

- **Detail & complexity**  
  - Put more tiny detail where you want the eye to rest.
  - Simplify other zones.

- **Scale**  
  - Make the important object bigger relative to others.

### Quick Check

- Squint or shrink the image.
- Ask: “What do I see first?”  
  - If the answer is not your intended subject, your hierarchy needs adjustment.

---

## Shape Language & Proportion

Shape language is how the **silhouette and proportions** of things communicate personality and rhythm, even before details appear.

### Shape Language

- **Round / soft shapes**  
  - Friendly, cute, calm, approachable.

- **Sharp / angular shapes**  
  - Aggressive, dynamic, tense.

- **Blocky / chunky shapes**  
  - Solid, stable, strong.

You can redesign the same subject (e.g., a cassowary) with different shape languages to change its vibe without changing the core concept.

### Proportion & Big–Medium–Small

- Aim for a **big / medium / small** ratio in major shapes (roughly 60/30/10).
  - One large dominant mass.  
  - One medium secondary mass.  
  - One or a few small accents.

This keeps the design from feeling evenly chopped and boring.

### Silhouette Readability

- If you fill the subject as a solid black shape:
  - Can you still recognize what it is?
  - Is the outline interesting and clear?

A strong silhouette makes the design read at a glance, even when tiny.

---

## Style Eras & Visual Genre

Style acts like a **world filter** placed over your subject and composition. Changing style/era can make the **same subject** live in completely different universes.

### Same Subject, Different Eras

Example: cassowary, centered mid-shot, same pose:

- **’70s Retro**  
  - Rounded, chunky shapes; warm sun-faded colors; halftone and light distress.  
  - Feels nostalgic, poster-like, analog.

- **Bauhaus**  
  - Strict geometry; flat primaries; minimal detail and texture.  
  - Feels rational, design-school, graphic.

- **Y2K Techno-Futurist**  
  - Neon and chrome; glow, HUD overlays, gradients.  
  - Feels digital, energetic, early-2000s sci-fi.

### What Style Communicates

- **Time period** – when this “world” seems to exist.
- **Medium** – screenprint, vector graphic, glossy digital render, etc.
- **Audience** – gig poster, tech ad, gallery print, cartoon?

### Practical Use

- Decide on a **style era** early:
  - It sets expectations for color, texture, and shape.
- You can create **collections** (e.g., “cassowary through the decades”) by:
  - Holding SUBJECT + COMPOSITION constant.
  - Swapping only the STYLE-era block.

---

### Hard vs Soft Knobs (Prompt Blocks)

For your prompt brain, it helps to separate:

- **Hard / structural knobs** (change the bones of the image)
  - **COMPOSITION** – where things are, camera angle/distance.
  - **VALUE DESIGN** – what’s light, what’s dark.
  - **COLOR (as value roles)** – which areas get high contrast vs low.

- **Soft / entangled knobs** (change the feel of the same structure)
  - **STYLE** – medium/era (’70s poster, Bauhaus, Y2K).
  - **MOOD** – emotional grade (ominous vs playful).
  - **TEXTURE** – object age and material (clean vs 40% distressed).
  - **LIGHTING** – edge sharpness, shadow shapes, drama level.

Workflow rule (earned from Lessons 1–2):

1. Lock **hard knobs** first (subject, composition, value hierarchy).
2. Then experiment with **soft knobs** one at a time so you can see exactly what each one does.

---

## Mood & Atmosphere

Mood is the **emotional grade** applied to an image. It often rides on top of an existing style, rather than replacing it.

### Mood as a Soft Knob

With STYLE and COMPOSITION fixed, changing only **[MOOD]** can affect:

- **Brightness & contrast**  
  - “Ominous” → darker overall, deeper shadows, harsher contrasts.  
  - “Playful” → brighter, softer transitions, less harsh darks.

- **Palette temperature**  
  - “Dramatic / tense” → cooler, more intense contrasts.  
  - “Warm, comforting” → more warm hues, fewer harsh blues.

- **Subtle expression / attitude**  
  - Same pose, but slightly different posture, tilt, or surrounding space can feel calm vs anxious.

### MOOD vs STYLE

- **STYLE** answers: *what medium / era / rendering approach is this?*
- **MOOD** answers: *what feeling does it carry?*

You can keep STYLE constant (e.g., Bauhaus graphic) and use MOOD to tilt it towards:
- playful / educational, or
- stark / serious / authoritarian.

---

## Texture & Surface (Wear, Grain, Distress)

Texture is about how **physical** the image feels: clean digital asset, fresh print, or worn object.

### Clean vs Distressed

With design locked (same cassowary, same composition, same colors):

- **Low texture (≈10% wear)**  
  - Almost clean print, subtle paper grain.  
  - Feels recent, well-kept, closer to a digital mockup.

- **High texture (≈40% wear)**  
  - Heavy grain, scratches, ink chipping, folds/creases.  
  - Feels old, handled, discovered, archival.

The silhouette and design do **not** change; only the perceived **age and physical history** of the object changes.

### What Texture Controls

- Whether something reads as:
  - **On-screen graphic** (very clean).  
  - **Fresh printed poster** (light grain).  
  - **Vintage artifact / gig poster / zine** (heavy distress).

### Practical Rule

- Solve **readability first** (value, composition, palette).
- Add **TEXTURE late** as a finishing knob:
  - Decide how “worn” or “clean” each version of the design should feel.

---

## Lighting Basics & Edge Control

Lighting describes how light hits the forms; edge control describes how hard or soft the transitions are. Together, they control **depth, focus, and mood**.

### Lighting Fundamentals (Conceptual)

- **Direct, hard light**  
  - Strong, sharp-edged shadows.  
  - High drama, clear form.

- **Diffuse, soft light (overcast / big softbox)**  
  - Soft-edged shadows or almost none.  
  - Gentle, flatter, more forgiving.

- **Single main light vs multiple lights**  
  - One strong key light → clear direction, strong modeling.  
  - Fill/rim lights → soften contrast, highlight edges.

### Edge Types

- **Hard edges**  
  - Sudden value or color change.  
  - Use at the focal point and on crisp details.

- **Soft edges**  
  - Gradual transition.  
  - Use on form turns, secondary areas, less important details.

- **Lost edges**  
  - Edge disappears into background or shadow.  
  - Use where you want to de-emphasize or merge shapes.

---

### Lesson: Lighting-Only Sweep = Edges & Shadow Shapes

Context: Phase 2 – Exercise 4 (same cassowary, different lighting setups only).

We kept **COMPOSITION, SUBJECT, STYLE, COLOR, VALUE DESIGN, TEXTURE, MOOD** locked and changed only the **[LIGHTING]** block:

- North-light window  
- Clamshell (beauty lighting)  
- Hard noon  
- Overcast  

The goal: see how lighting alone changes **edge sharpness** and **shadow shapes** without redesigning anything else.

#### North-Light Window – Soft Directional

- One large, soft light source from the side (e.g., left).
- Clear light side and shadow side on the cassowary.
- **Shadows**: soft-edged, stretching away from the window side.
- **Edges**: 
  - Slightly crisper on the light side.
  - Softer and sometimes partially lost on the shadow side.

Use it for: gentle, natural depth and form; readable but not harsh.

#### Clamshell (Beauty Lighting) – Flattering & Even

- Soft key above + soft fill from below, mostly frontal.
- Shadows almost disappear; just a small soft shadow under the beak/casque.
- **Shadows**: minimal, very soft, low contrast.
- **Edges**:
  - Smooth transitions everywhere.
  - Very few hard edges; forms feel rounded and “beauty-lit”.

Use it for: portraits, “pretty” key art where you don’t want strong drama.

#### Hard Noon Sun – Harsh & Graphic

- Small, intense light source from directly above.
- **Shadows**: short, dark, sharply defined under beak, casque, and wings; strong cast shadows on body and background.
- **Edges**:
  - Hard edge between light and shadow.
  - High contrast on lit areas and cast shadows.

Use it for: dramatic, graphic, punchy looks where you want the lighting to shout.

#### Overcast Sky – Soft & Low-Contrast

- Huge diffuse light source from all directions.
- **Shadows**: extremely soft or almost invisible; very little cast shadow.
- **Edges**:
  - Mostly soft transitions.
  - Forms read more from gentle value shifts than from clear shadow shapes.

Use it for: calm, gentle, or mood-focused scenes where lighting shouldn’t dominate.

---

### The Real Lesson: Lighting = Edge & Shadow Control

Across all four:

- You didn’t change the **design** (cassowary, pose, style, colors), but:
  - Lighting changed how **3D** it felt.
  - Lighting changed how **sharp or soft** the image read.
  - Lighting changed the **mood** (harsh vs gentle vs flattering vs neutral).

Patterns:

- Hard, small light source → **hard edges, strong shadows, more drama**.
- Big, soft light source → **soft edges, weak shadows, calmer mood**.
- Frontal/clamshell → **flattering, low-drama**, good for “key art” clarity.
- Side or overhead → **stronger modeling**, more graphic shadows.

Practical takeaway:

- Treat **[LIGHTING]** as a separate knob from STYLE and COLOR.
- When an image feels “mushy,” try a **more directional light** (north-light or hard noon).
- When an image feels “too harsh,” move toward **softer setups** (overcast or clamshell).
- Always look at:
  - Where are the **hardest edges**?
  - What **shape** do the shadows make?
  - Does that support the **focal point** or distract from it?

---

## Reference Images & Structural Variations

Reference images are a way to **lock style, palette, and material**, while you experiment with structural changes like composition and framing.

### Role of Reference Images

- Anchor **STYLE** (brushwork, vector look, texture density).
- Anchor **COLOR** (palette and value range).
- Anchor **LIGHTING** (direction, softness, mood).

This means the model has a consistent visual “target” for how things should look and feel.

### Structural Variations

Once the reference is set, you can vary **structural blocks** such as:

- **[COMPOSITION]**
  - Angle, distance, subject placement.
- **Environment amount**
  - Tight crop vs wide environment.
- **Horizon and path lines**
  - High/low horizon, where leading lines point.

With STYLE/COLOR/LIGHTING anchored, different compositions feel like:

- **Different shots from the same scene**, not totally new art pieces.

### Practical Habit

- Use 1–3 reference images for **look & feel**.
- Then:
  - Duplicate the prompt.
  - Change only one structural block (often [COMPOSITION]).
  - Compare side-by-side → you clearly see what that one change does.

---

## Drift & Consistency (Lesson 4 Add-on)

Drift = the model changing “other stuff” while you try to change one thing.  
It matters when you need **consistency** more than novelty.

### Why / When Drift Matters

**Drift matters (high):**
- **Comics / sequences**: you need the same character face, outfit, proportions, and camera distance panel-to-panel.
- **Brand systems**: hero banners, icon sets, ad variants must stay consistent in layout, palette roles, and hierarchy.
- **Product/UI illustrations**: dashboard structures should remain stable or the “product story” breaks.
- **Local edits**: “only change the aura” shouldn’t quietly change lighting, colors, or proportions.

**Drift is fine (or helpful):**
- One-off art, exploration, and concepting—drift can discover better shapes, palettes, or compositions.

### Types of Drift (Track Separately)

1) **Framing drift** → subject position, crop, camera distance changes.  
2) **Element drift** → aura/UI layout/details change.  
3) **Style drift** → line weight, geometry sharpness, rendering approach changes.  
4) **Color/value drift** → saturation, contrast, value hierarchy changes.

Practical note:
- You can “feel like drift increased” when it’s just drift moving from one category to another.

### Lesson 4 Connection: Background + Typography Changes “Who’s the Hero”

Even if the SUBJECT is locked, drift can sneak in through:
- background density,
- typography blocks (headline/KPI/sidebar),
- and value contrast shifts.

If the UI gets more structure/contrast than the character, the UI becomes the hero.

### Lock List vs Play List (Stage-Appropriate Habit)

**LOCK (for consistency):**
- SUBJECT traits (silhouette, face, outfit)
- COMPOSITION (left third vs centered, crop level)
- VALUE DESIGN (darkest/brightest roles)
- PALETTE roles (where accents are allowed)

**PLAY (for controlled variation):**
- TYPO zone layout (headline vs KPI strip vs sidebar)
- BACKGROUND density (simple vs dashboard-heavy)
- LIGHTING softness (flat vs premium)
- TEXTURE amount (clean vs premium)

### Quick Consistency Checklist (10-second audit)

- Is the **darkest value** still the intended hero (e.g., owl head/chest)?
- Did the **crop** change (waist-up → full body / tight face)?
- Did the **UI** get too crisp/high-contrast and steal focus?
- Did accent color spread beyond “small hits” and become a second focal point?

### The Hierarchy Triangle (Keeps the Hero Stable)

To keep the hero consistent across variants, stabilize:
- **Space**: hero gets the most breathing room.
- **Contrast**: hero gets the strongest value contrast.
- **Detail**: hero gets the sharpest edges / most micro-structure.

If any of those migrate to the UI, the UI becomes the hero.

---

## Grayscale Readability & Thumbnail Checks

Grayscale checks are a fast way to test **readability and value design**. If it works in black and white at small size, it’s usually solid.

### Grayscale Check Steps

1. Generate your image.
2. Convert it to **grayscale**.
3. Shrink it to a **small thumbnail** (around 150–250px wide).
4. Ask:
   - Can you instantly locate the **subject**?
   - Is the **focal point** still obvious?
   - Does the background stay subordinate?

If the answer is no, you need to adjust value relationships.

### Using a Value Design Block

You can write a short **[VALUE DESIGN]** note in your prompt, e.g.:

- **Lightest**: orb and its glow = brightest element.
- **Darkest**: subject body/head = one dark mass against lighter background.
- **Mid-tones**: environment and HUD elements = middle values that do not compete with the focal area.

This makes the hierarchy explicit and more reproducible.

### Why This Matters

- Prevents “everything glowing equally” (common in Y2K / neon styles).
- Lets you go wild with color and texture **without** sacrificing clarity.
- Makes designs more print-friendly and logo-like when needed.

---

## Print-Ready Thinking (Inks, Halftones, Output)

*(To be expanded more after dedicated print-focused exercises.)*

Key ideas you’ll explore later:

- Limiting to **3–4 inks** and still keeping the subject clear.
- Using **halftones and overprints** to fake extra colors.
- Ensuring edges and shapes stay **clean when vectorized and zoomed in**.

---

## Style Bibles & Visual Consistency

*(To be expanded more once you build a full Style Card and asset set.)*

Future focus:

- Creating a **Style Card**:
  - Palette (HEX codes).
  - Line weights.
  - Texture percentages.
- Keeping multiple assets (shirt, poster, sticker, etc.) looking like they belong to the **same universe**.
- Tracking seeds and prompt blocks so you can **recreate the look on demand**.
