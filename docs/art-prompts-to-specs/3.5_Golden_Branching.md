## Lesson 3 – Exercise 5 (DALL·E Adaptation)
### “Golden Reference” Branching (Seed-Equivalent)

DALL·E does not expose user-set seeds like Stable Diffusion.  
So the **seed-branching concept** becomes a **reference-anchoring workflow**.

---

### Core idea
In DALL·E, a **clean, simple “golden” image** can function as a **seed-equivalent**:

- **Golden base** = identity + structure lock  
- **Branches** = controlled prompt variations that stay in the same universe

A minimal baseline anchors better than an effect-heavy version.

---

### Why “simple golden” works best
A clean base image usually has:
- a clearer silhouette
- less confounding texture/effects
- more stable proportions
- a more reliable value hierarchy

This makes it a stronger anchor for future variations.

### DALL·E seed-equivalent workflow

1) **Generate a clean baseline**
   - minimal texture
   - calm lighting
   - strict value hierarchy
   - limited palette

2) **Declare it golden**
   - save the image
   - log:
     - prompt text
     - date
     - any DALL·E options (size/quality/style if used)
   - add to your Style Bible

3) **Use the golden as a reference**
   When your interface supports image+text prompting:

   **ANCHOR NOTE (paste into prompts)**  
   Use the attached reference image as a strict anchor for subject identity, silhouette, and Utala style.  
   Preserve proportions, pose, and overall composition.  
   Apply only the listed changes; keep background subordinate.

4) **Create prompt branches**
   Make A/B/C variations with **≤ 2 changes per branch**:
   - TEXTURE % changes
   - warm vs cool palette
   - lighting-only sweep (north-light → overcast)
   - minor background simplification

5) **Compare in grayscale**
   Choose the branch that preserves:
   - value hierarchy
   - silhouette clarity
   - “friendly” shape/eye language if that’s a goal

6) **Select a canonical branch**
   Mark the winner as **Style Bible canonical**.

### Logging template (git-first)

**Golden pick**
- Prompt:
- Date:
- DALL·E options (if any):
- Why this is golden:

**Branches (≤ 2 changes each)**
- Branch A:
- Branch B:
- Branch C:

**Canonical**
- Winner:
- Reason:

### Rule earned
**In DALL·E, a golden reference image is the closest practical equivalent to a seed you can branch from.**
