[TYPO_FINTECH_GENERIC]
Abstract corporate typography: clear zones for a headline and short copy, represented as simple rectangular blocks and lines, not legible words. Layout should feel like a financial technology marketing page: one main headline block, 1–2 smaller sub-lines, and a few short data labels near charts. Any “text” should be stylized as abstract bars or grey lines, not readable language.


[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed, clean geometric feathers, friendly but professional expression

3) Variant A – “Hero headline + dashboard”

[COMPOSITION] clean corporate hero layout: data owl on the left third, space on the right for abstract “dashboard” shapes; medium shot from waist-up equivalent, plenty of white space and clear margins
[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed, clean geometric feathers, friendly but professional expression

[BACKGROUND] abstract interface area on the right: a main dashboard panel with a couple of smaller panels beneath it, simple charts and graphs suggested by bars and lines, all kept subordinate to the owl
[TYPO] hero headline block above the main dashboard panel and one short subheading block below it, all represented as simple light rectangles and lines, no legible words, just the feel of a fintech marketing headline

[STYLE] modern fintech corporate illustration: clean vector-like shapes, subtle geometry, professional and polished, no cartoon exaggeration, no painterly texture
[COLOR] use [FINTECH_PALETTE]
[TEXTURE] flat digital surfaces, no distress or grain
[LIGHTING] soft, even lighting with minimal shading, just enough to separate layers
[MOOD] calm, trustworthy, data-driven

[NEGATIVE] no real company logos, no readable text or words, no watermark; no extra limbs; no realistic photography; no heavy gradients; no cluttered background
[OUTPUT] widescreen hero ratio suitable for a financial technology website; must read clearly in grayscale

4) Variant B – “KPI strip + cards”

Here we change only [TYPO] + [BACKGROUND]; everything else stays aligned.

[COMPOSITION] clean corporate hero layout: data owl on the left third, space on the right for abstract “dashboard” shapes; medium shot from waist-up equivalent, plenty of white space and clear margins
[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed, clean geometric feathers, friendly but professional expression

[BACKGROUND] a grid of three to four “metric cards” on the right, each card containing a small chart area and a compact numeric block, arranged in a neat grid that feels like a fintech KPI dashboard
[TYPO] a slim KPI strip along the top of the cards with several small rectangular blocks suggesting numbers and labels, plus one slightly larger headline block near the top-right; all blocks and lines only, no legible words

[STYLE] modern fintech corporate illustration: clean vector-like shapes, subtle geometry, professional and polished, no cartoon exaggeration, no painterly texture
[COLOR] use [FINTECH_PALETTE]
[TEXTURE] flat digital surfaces, no distress or grain

5) Variant C – “Side-panel navigation + main chart”

Again, change only [TYPO] + [BACKGROUND].

[BACKGROUND] a large main chart panel on the right with a tall, slim side panel on its left edge, suggesting a navigation sidebar; inside the main panel, include one clear line graph and one bar cluster, abstracted as simple shapes
[TYPO] vertical stack of small rectangular “menu” blocks in the sidebar, plus a single headline block at the top of the main chart panel and a couple of short caption blocks near the bottom; all as abstract rectangles and lines, no legible words
