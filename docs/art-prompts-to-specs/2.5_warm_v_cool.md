[COMPOSITION] centered character, mid-shot from thighs up, simple flat background, plenty of negative space in a clean poster layout
[SUBJECT] elegant stylized cassowary standing upright, facing the viewer, holding a small glowing orb at chest level with its wings
[STYLE] 1970s retro poster illustration, rounded simplified shapes, chunky linework, playful graphic design, slightly sun-faded print look
[LIGHTING] soft, even lighting with gentle falloff, no harsh shadows, smooth simple shading that keeps the design graphic and flat
[VALUE DESIGN] clear three-step hierarchy: the orb and its inner glow are the brightest elements; the cassowary’s body and head form one darker mass that reads clearly against the background; background shapes and decorative bands sit in middle values that support the silhouette and never get as bright as the orb
[TEXTURE] subtle paper grain, light halftone dots in the shadows and large color areas, about 10–15% distressed print wear around the poster edges
[MOOD] cozy, nostalgic, friendly, slightly goofy, easy to read even in grayscale
[OUTPUT] vintage-inspired poster ratio, crisp but slightly imperfect edges, high resolution suitable for print

## warm

[COLOR] warm limited 1970s palette with 4 main colors:
- cassowary body and head in deep burnt orange and warm brick red as the darkest values,
- orb glow in bright pale butter yellow as the single lightest value in the image,
- background bands and shapes in mustard yellow and muted avocado green mid-tones,
- large flat background area in a soft, slightly desaturated beige that stays lighter than the cassowary body but darker than the orb,
- no blues or purples; all hues lean warm, earthy, and sun-faded


## cool

[COLOR] cool-leaning 1970s palette with 4 main colors:
- cassowary body and head in deep teal and dark petrol blue as the darkest values,
- orb glow in bright minty off-white as the single lightest value in the image,
- background bands and shapes in muted turquoise and dusty lavender mid-tones,
- large flat background area in a soft, slightly desaturated cool gray that stays lighter than the cassowary body but darker than the orb,
- no strong oranges or reds; hues stay cool and slightly pastel while still feeling retro and sun-faded


## Why the cool one feels sharper

Even though we only changed hue, not the value “job”, in practice:

Cool = slightly darker, cleaner darks
Deep teal / petrol blue often behave like clearer darks than burnt orange / brick red, especially on a light-ish background.

Dark teal vs soft gray → crisp edge.

Burnt orange vs beige → edges can feel a bit “mushy” or close in value.

Cool vs neutral background = higher local contrast
If your background ended up a cool gray and the cassowary body is very dark teal, you get:

Strong, simple dark-vs-mid contrast on the silhouette.
On the warm one, deep orange vs beige can be closer in value → less “snap”.

Warm palettes can “melt” together
Warm hues near each other (burnt orange, brick red, mustard, beige) can blur into one big warm mass, especially in small thumbnails.
Cool palettes tend to create cleaner separations when paired with neutrals.
