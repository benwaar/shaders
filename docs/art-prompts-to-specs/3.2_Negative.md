## Copy block: Y2K-safe NEGATIVE (prevents “everything glowing equally”)

[NEGATIVE]
No text, no logos, no watermark.
No extra limbs or warped anatomy.
No full-frame glow; do not let secondary elements match the focal brightness.

# OWL ARCHIVIST — UTALA TEMPLATE (Lesson 3-friendly)

[COMPOSITION] centered hero subject, mid-shot, clean poster layout with generous margins

[SUBJECT] calm, geometric owl with layered wing panels and fine etched contour lines
