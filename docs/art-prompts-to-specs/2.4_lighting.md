[COMPOSITION] centered character, mid-shot from thighs up, slight low angle to feel heroic, abstract circular HUD shapes and swooshes behind the cassowary, all contained within a clean poster layout with margins
[SUBJECT] sleek stylized cassowary with smooth armor-like feathers, standing upright, facing the viewer, holding a small glowing orb at chest level with its wings, subtle tech details on feathers and beak
[STYLE] early-2000s Y2K techno-futurist artwork, beveled forms, UI overlays, soft chrome accents, simplified large gradients instead of noisy micro-detail
[COLOR] cool neon palette: electric blue and magenta for the cassowary body in darker values, cyan and lime accents in mid-values, white reserved mainly for the orb and small highlights
[VALUE DESIGN] clear three-step hierarchy: orb and its glow are the brightest elements; cassowary body and head form a single clearly darker mass than the background for a strong silhouette; HUD circles and tech shapes sit in mid-tone values that support the silhouette and never compete with the orb; no other area is as bright as the orb
[TEXTURE] smooth surfaces, soft bloom around lights, faint scanline or HUD noise, light overall grain; background UI elements low in contrast
[MOOD] energetic, futuristic, slightly over-the-top, playful but still very readable in grayscale
[OUTPUT] poster ratio, crisp details, high resolution, strong readability even when converted to black and white


## Variant 1 – North-Light Window
[LIGHTING] soft north-light window from the left side of frame, large diffuse light source, gentle falloff across the cassowary’s body, soft-edged shadows falling to the right, no harsh speculars; edges on the light side slightly crisper, shadow side edges soft and slightly lost into the background


## Variant 2 – Clamshell (Beauty Lighting)
[LIGHTING] clamshell beauty lighting setup, one soft key light slightly above and in front of the cassowary and a softer fill light from below, almost straight-on; very minimal shadows under the beak and casque, soft symmetrical highlights in the eyes and on the orb, overall low shadow depth with very soft, barely visible shadow shapes and smooth edge transitions


## Variant 3 – Hard Noon Sun
[LIGHTING] hard noon sunlight from directly above, small intense light source, strong high-contrast lighting; sharp-edged shadows under the beak, casque, and wings, narrow and clearly defined shadow shapes on the body and background, hard specular highlights on the beak and casque that are bright but never as bright as the orb, overall strong edge acuity on lit-side forms

## Variant 4 – Overcast Sky
[LIGHTING] overcast sky lighting, huge diffuse light source from all directions, very low contrast, extremely soft or almost imperceptible shadows; the cassowary’s forms read mainly through value and color shifts rather than cast shadows, edges are generally soft with a few slightly crisper edges reserved around the orb and head to maintain focus


## You didn’t change the **design** (cassowary, pose, style, colors), but:
  - Lighting changed how **3D** it felt.
  - Lighting changed how **sharp or soft** the image read.
  - Lighting changed the **mood** (harsh vs gentle vs flattering vs neutral).

**Patterns you earned:**

- Hard, small light source → **hard edges, strong shadows, more drama**.
- Big, soft light source → **soft edges, weak shadows, calmer mood**.
- Frontal/clamshell → **flattering, low-drama**, good for “key art” clarity.
- Side or overhead → **stronger modeling**, more graphic shadows.

**Practical takeaway:**

- Treat **[LIGHTING]** as a separate knob from STYLE and COLOR.
- When an image feels “mushy,” try a **more directional light** (north-light or hard noon).
- When an image feels “too harsh,” move toward **softer setups** (overcast or clamshell).
- Always look at:
  - Where are the **hardest edges**?
  - What **shape** do the shadows make?
  - Does that support the **focal point** or distract from it?
