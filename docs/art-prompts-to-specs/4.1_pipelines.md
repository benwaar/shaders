[FINTECH_PALETTE]
Fintech corporate palette:
- Primary base: deep navy for main shapes and body.
- Primary accent: bright corporate blue for key UI elements and highlights.
- Neutrals: off-white and cool light grey for backgrounds and large panels.
- Secondary: cool mid-grey for secondary shapes and dividers.
- Data accent: small hits of teal or blue-green only on positive data or key chart lines.
Overall mood: calm, professional, trustworthy; avoid bright candy colors and noisy multicolor schemes.

Pass A – Composition & Subject only (shapes first)

Do I like the framing, pose, and basic shape read

[COMPOSITION] clean corporate hero layout: owl on the left third, space on the right for abstract “dashboard” shapes; medium shot from waist-up equivalent, plenty of white space and clear margins
[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed
[BACKGROUND] very simple abstract interface: a few light rectangles and lines suggesting charts and panels, kept soft and subordinate, no detailed data yet

[STYLE] flat, minimal illustration, no gradients, no special effects
[COLOR] simple grayscale plus one mid-blue accent; keep everything low-key and neutral
[TEXTURE] no visible texture, clean flat shapes
[LIGHTING] soft, even lighting, almost no shading
[MOOD] neutral, professional, calm

[NEGATIVE] no text, no logos, no watermark; no extra limbs; no busy background; no realistic photography
