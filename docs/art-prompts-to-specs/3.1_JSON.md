# OWL ARCHIVIST — UTALA TEMPLATE (Lesson 3-friendly)

[COMPOSITION] centered hero subject, mid-shot, clean poster layout with generous margins

[SUBJECT] calm, geometric owl with layered wing panels and fine etched contour lines
[POSE] front-facing, wings folded into a shield-like silhouette
[FOCAL PROP] small luminous data-crystal held at the sternum

[BACKGROUND] quiet library-constellation grid, soft circular framing rings, minimal sacred geometry accents

[STYLE] Utala visual style — sacred geometry + sci-fi minimalism, perfect symmetry, fine etched lines, matte graphite texture, luminous engraving
[LIGHTING] diffuse glow with subtle rim light, no harsh specular highlights
[COLOR] limited 3–5 color system, high value separation, accents reserved for the data-crystal
[VALUE DESIGN] data-crystal is the brightest element; owl body/head read as the darkest coherent mass; background glyphs and rings remain mid-tones and low contrast
[TEXTURE] matte graphite with subtle brushed-metal hints, minimal grain, no noisy micro-texture
[MOOD] calm power, sacred technology, quiet intelligence, archival serenity

[NEGATIVE] no text, no typography, no letters or numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signatures; no extra limbs or duplicated heads; no malformed anatomy; no mushy edges; no noisy micro-detail; no busy background; no unintended gradients; no lens flare; maintain clean silhouette and strong grayscale readability

[OUTPUT] poster ratio, high clarity, crisp edges, print-friendly, strong readability in grayscale
