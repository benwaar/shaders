## Exercise 4 · BOTH: Upload a Reference + Vary One Structural Parameter

### 0️⃣ Prep – Choose / upload your reference

Pick any **cassowary-in-rainforest** image you like (photo or painting).  
When you prompt, you’ll:

- Tell the model to **match the reference** for STYLE / COLOR / TEXTURE / LIGHTING.
- Only change **one structural thing** each time (here: [COMPOSITION]).

---

### 1️⃣ Base prompt (Version 1)

Use this as your **starting prompt**.  
(Replace “uploaded cassowary rainforest reference” with whatever you’re actually using.)

> [REFERENCE] use the *uploaded cassowary rainforest reference image* as the style, color, and lighting guide. Match its rendering style, overall mood, and level of detail.
>
> [COMPOSITION] medium shot, cassowary centered in the frame, shown from chest up, head and neck filling about 35% of the canvas height, dense rainforest foliage softly blurred in the background, subtle depth with lighter tones in the distance  
>
> [SUBJECT] wild cassowary standing on the forest floor in a humid tropical rainforest, surrounded by ferns, broad-leaf plants, and scattered fallen leaves  
>
> [STYLE] hyperrealistic wildlife illustration matching the uploaded reference, natural proportions, detailed feathers and casque, cinematic framing  
>
> [COLOR] rich deep greens and cool teals for the foliage, muted earthy browns on the forest floor, subtle iridescent blues and reds on the cassowary, harmonized with the palette of the reference image  
>
> [TEXTURE] detailed feather texture, damp bark and leaf surfaces, slight atmospheric haze between foreground and background, with surface treatment similar to the reference  
>
> [LIGHTING] soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the canopy, gentle dappled light on the cassowary, slight bloom where light catches wet leaves, consistent with the direction and feel of light in the reference  
>
> [MOOD] quiet, immersive, slightly tense but peaceful, feeling of being deep in untouched jungle  
>
> [DETAILS] fine detail on the cassowary’s eye and casque, small insects or tiny floating dust motes in the shafts of light, no visible human structures or trails  
>
> [OUTPUT] high-resolution illustration, 4:5 vertical aspect ratio, poster-print ready  

Generate once with this **unaltered**.

### Base prompt (Version 2) - Reference-First Prompt Template

[REFERENCE] use the uploaded cassowary rainforest image "casso.jpg" as the primary guide.  
Match its overall style, color palette, lighting, and texture.  
If anything in the text conflicts with the image, **follow the image**.

[COMPOSITION] medium shot, cassowary centered in the frame, shown from chest up, 
head and neck filling about 35% of the canvas height, dense rainforest foliage softly 
blurred in the background, subtle depth with lighter tones in the distance

[SUBJECT] wild cassowary standing on the forest floor in a humid tropical rainforest, 
surrounded by ferns, broad-leaf plants, and scattered fallen leaves

[MOOD] quiet, immersive, slightly tense but peaceful, feeling of being deep in untouched jungle

[DETAILS] fine detail on the cassowary’s eye and casque, small insects or tiny floating dust motes 
in the shafts of light, no visible human structures or trails

[OUTPUT] high-resolution illustration, 4:5 vertical aspect ratio, poster-print ready

When to add STYLE/COLOR/TEXTURE/LIGHTING text

Only if you want to tilt away from the reference, e.g.:

“Match the reference but slightly warmer overall.”

“Keep the same style, but increase contrast so it’s more print-ready.”

“Same lighting direction, but brighter midtones.”

### 2️⃣ Structural Variations – Change Only [COMPOSITION]

Now **keep everything identical** except [COMPOSITION].  
Copy-paste the entire prompt above and swap just that block.

#### Version 2 – Tiny in frame, forest dominance

> [COMPOSITION] cassowary small in the frame, positioned in the lower-left corner, full body taking up about 15% of the canvas height; towering tree trunks and dense foliage filling the upper two thirds of the image, emphasizing the scale and height of the forest, with the animal feeling small inside its environment  

(Everything else: [SUBJECT], [STYLE], [COLOR], [TEXTURE], [LIGHTING], [MOOD], [DETAILS], [OUTPUT] stays exactly the same as Version 1.)

---

#### Version 3 – Dramatic low angle (power shot)

> [COMPOSITION] dramatic low-angle view from near ground level, cassowary in the foreground with its legs and lower body dominating the bottom half of the frame, head and casque rising into the upper half, nearly reaching the top edge; background trees compressed into the upper third to enhance the towering, imposing presence  

Again, leave all other blocks unchanged.

---

#### Version 4 – Top-down “god’s-eye” view

> [COMPOSITION] top-down view from high above, looking straight down onto a small forest clearing; the cassowary is tiny, near the center of the frame, occupying about 10% of the canvas height, surrounded on all sides by overlapping treetops and foliage that fill the rest of the image, forming a natural circular vignette around the clearing  

Everything else stays identical.

---

#### Version 5 – Side view on a path (journey feel)

> [COMPOSITION] cassowary in side view walking along a narrow forest path, body placed on the left vertical third line of the canvas, taking up about 25% of the image height; the path starts at the bottom center and curves gently into the midground, guiding the eye, with dense vegetation framing the right side and upper edges  

Same deal: only [COMPOSITION] changes.

---

### 3️⃣ Review Questions (what to look for)

After you generate the set, compare them like a storyboard:

- How does the **same reference style** feel across totally different framings?
- Which version makes the cassowary feel most:
  - **Powerful?** (likely the low angle)
  - **Vulnerable / observed?** (likely the top-down)
  - **Lonely / small in a huge world?** (tiny-in-frame composition)
  - **Narrative / journey-like?** (side view on path)
- Did the **style, palette, and lighting** stay mostly consistent across images?
- Do you see how much of the change comes from **composition alone**, not from restyling?
