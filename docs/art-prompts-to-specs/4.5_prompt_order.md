### Lesson 5: Prompt Engineering — STYLE-first vs COMPOSITION-first (Framing Drift Test)

Goal:
- Run the same scene twice with only one change: prompt order.
- Measure whether the owl “drifts” toward center / zoom / crop changes when STYLE leads vs when COMPOSITION leads.

[PALETTE_DRIFT_TEST] (high-contrast, non-fintech on purpose)
- Background: warm off-white / light cream
- Subject base: near-black / charcoal
- Accent: electric cyan (UI + halo)
- Secondary accent: muted coral (tiny hits only, optional)
Rule: mostly 2–3 flat colours; no gradients.


[BASE_SCENE_DRIFT_TEST] (super simple)
[SUBJECT] geometric owl analyst icon, waist-up, front-facing, clean silhouette, charcoal body, simple blazer chest panel
[LAYOUT] owl on the left third; on the right: ONE large rounded-rectangle “dashboard” panel with 2–3 tiny chart marks (a line + 3 bars), very minimal
[AURA] single circular halo behind owl head (cyan), simple ring only
[TYPO] optional abstract headline block (one rectangle) above the right panel; NO readable text
[STYLE] flat vector, crisp edges, minimal detail, no texture, no gradients


## 5A — STYLE-FIRST (drift-prone)

[STYLE] flat vector poster illustration, crisp geometric shapes, balanced and symmetrical design language, clean corporate hero look, very minimal detail, no gradients, no texture
[COLOR] use [PALETTE_DRIFT_TEST]
[MOOD] calm, polished, “designed” like a brand key visual

[COMPOSITION] widescreen hero banner; owl positioned on the left third; generous margins; clear open space on the right for a single dashboard panel

[SUBJECT] geometric owl analyst icon, waist-up, front-facing, charcoal body, simple blazer chest panel, friendly-professional expression

[BACKGROUND/UI] on the right, ONE large rounded dashboard panel containing a simple line and three bars (abstract shapes only). optional: one headline rectangle above the panel, no legible text

[AURA] behind the owl’s head only: a single cyan ring halo, simple and subordinate (owl remains darkest/most dominant)

[NEGATIVE] no readable text, no logos, no watermark, no realism, no clutter, no extra limbs
[OUTPUT] widescreen hero ratio; strong silhouette

## 5B — COMPOSITION-FIRST (layout-lock)

[COMPOSITION] widescreen hero banner; LOCK framing: owl must sit on the left third (not centered), waist-up crop, generous margins; right side reserved for a single dashboard panel; do not rebalance the layout
[COMPOSITION PRIORITY] if any conflict occurs, keep the owl left-third and keep the right panel fully visible
