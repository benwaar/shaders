# Lesson: COLOR-Only Changes Hit Hard

- Changing **only the [COLOR] block** can drastically alter:
  - Readability (value contrast, what pops vs recedes)
  - Mood (warm vs cool vs neutral)
  - Perceived style (retro, mystical, graphic, etc.)

- Even with **COMPOSITION, SUBJECT, STYLE, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, MOOD** held constant:
  - The image can feel like a completely different design.
  - Some palettes become much more **print-ready** or **logo-like** than others.

- Practical takeaway:
  - Treat **COLOR** as its own experimental layer.
  - Run **A/B/C tests** by changing *only* color.
  - Always do a quick **grayscale check** to see which palette gives the clearest subject/background separation.

# Lesson: COMPOSITION-Only Changes = New Story, Same Assets  

- Changing **only the [COMPOSITION] block** radically shifts:  
  - **Scale & power** – close-up vs tiny-in-frame flips who feels big: subject or environment.  
  - **Psychology** – low-angle = imposing; top-down = vulnerable/observed; distant = lonely.  
  - **Focus** – same subject + setting, but our eye follows whatever lines/spacing guide it (paths, clearings, framing foliage).  

- With **SUBJECT, STYLE, COLOR, TEXTURE, LIGHTING, MOOD** held constant:  
  - Each image suggests a **different narrative moment**:  
    - Medium shot → quiet encounter.  
    - Small in frame → animal swallowed by its habitat.  
    - Low angle → “boss fight” / dominance energy.  
    - Top-down → documentary / god’s-eye / surveillance vibe.  
    - Side view on path → journey, motion, direction.  
  - You get a **cohesive series** (same world) without rewriting complex detail blocks.  

- Composition quietly controls **where we look first**:  
  - Rule-of-thirds vs centered placement changes tension.  
  - Curved paths and leading lines act as built-in eye guides.  
  - Foreground framing (leaves, trunks, shadows) adds depth and “peeking in” feeling.  

- Practical takeaway:  
  - Treat **COMPOSITION** as a separate **“story knob”** from everything else.  
  - Prototype multiple shots of the **same prompt** by varying only [COMPOSITION]:  
    - Angle (eye-level / low / high / top-down)  
    - Distance (close / medium / far / tiny-in-frame)  
    - Placement (center / thirds / pushed to edge, with or without leading lines)  
  - Build quick **shot lists** (close, wide, overhead, path-following) for each subject, like a film director planning a scene.

## Lesson: Reference + Structural Tweaks = Controlled Variations

- Using a **reference image** while changing only **one structural block** (like [COMPOSITION]):
  - Locks in a consistent **style, palette, and lighting** across outputs.
  - Makes the effect of that **single change** very easy to see and understand.

- “Structural” means anything that affects **space and geometry**, not surface finish:
  - Framing, angle, and camera height  
  - Distance (close-up vs wide)  
  - Subject placement (center, thirds, tiny in corner)  
  - Path lines, horizon placement, and how much environment you show  

- With **STYLE, COLOR, TEXTURE, LIGHTING** anchored to the reference:
  - Variations feel like **shots from the same film**, not random new artworks.
  - You can study how structural choices alone affect:
    - **Scale** (who feels big vs small)
    - **Mood** (intimate vs epic vs ominous)
    - **Focus** (do we read “animal portrait” or “environment first”?)  

- Practical takeaway:
  - Treat the **reference** as your “look and feel” anchor.
  - Treat one structural block (often **[COMPOSITION]**) as the knob you twist:
    - Duplicate the prompt.
    - Change just that block.
    - Compare side-by-side for cause-and-effect learning.
  - This is how you build **coherent series** and learn what each parameter really does, without chasing random style drift.

## Lesson: STYLE / MOOD / TEXTURE = Soft, Entangled Sliders

Context: Exercise 5 – Observe visual drift when STYLE / MOOD / TEXTURE are toggled individually (cassowary subject).

- Unlike COMPOSITION and COLOR, which give big, clean, structural changes,
  STYLE / MOOD / TEXTURE are “soft” knobs:
  - They mostly change HOW the cassowary is rendered, not WHAT or WHERE it is.

------------------------------------------------------------
STYLE-only changes (medium shift)
------------------------------------------------------------

With COMPOSITION + SUBJECT + COLOR fixed:

- Changing only [STYLE] mostly feels like changing medium:
  - Flat vector → logo / icon / poster.
  - Painterly → storybook illustration.
  - Realistic / 3D → wildlife / concept art still.
- Pose and silhouette can stay the same, but:
  - Edge sharpness changes (crisp vs soft).
  - Detail level changes (blocky shapes vs fine feathers).
  - Shading method changes (flat vs painterly vs smooth gradients).

Takeaway:
- STYLE = “what tool/medium made this?”
- Choose STYLE early, then keep it stable while you tweak other blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------
MOOD-only changes (emotional grading)
------------------------------------------------------------

With STYLE + TEXTURE held constant:

- Changing only [MOOD] pushes:
  - Contrast and lighting drama (ominous → darker, higher contrast; playful → brighter, softer).
  - Micro-expression / attitude (same pose, different vibe).
  - Sometimes palette temperature (menacing → cooler/more intense; playful → warmer/candier).
- This can FEEL like a style change even when the STYLE text is identical.

Takeaway:
- MOOD = “emotional grade” applied on top of a fixed medium.
- Use MOOD to tilt feeling (neutral → tense → friendly) without redesigning the asset.

------------------------------------------------------------
TEXTURE-only changes (era & object feel)
------------------------------------------------------------

With STYLE + MOOD fixed:

- Changing only [TEXTURE] alters the physical/print feel:
  - Clean → modern digital asset.
  - Light grain (~20%) → subtle print / risograph / indie zine.
  - Heavy distress (~40%) → vintage gig poster / worn T-shirt / artifact.
- Design and silhouette stay the same, but:
  - The “type of object” changes (logo file vs printed poster vs aged scan).
  - Noise can either support or hurt readability depending on value contrast.

Takeaway:
- TEXTURE = “what kind of physical object is this?” (screen, fresh print, worn print, scanned artifact).
- Decide TEXTURE late, after silhouette and palette read clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------
Global takeaway for Exercise 5
------------------------------------------------------------

- COMPOSITION + COLOR = hard structure knobs (big, clear changes).
- STYLE / MOOD / TEXTURE = soft, entangled polish knobs (subtle and interdependent).

Workflow rule earned:

1) Lock COMPOSITION + SUBJECT (what and where).
2) Lock COLOR (palette / value structure).
3) Pick STYLE (medium) and keep it consistent.
4) Adjust MOOD (emotional grade).
5) Add TEXTURE last (print / era / physicality).

This is the main learning: which knobs are structural vs soft,
and what job each of the soft ones (STYLE, MOOD, TEXTURE) should do in the system.
