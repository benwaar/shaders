This is the “don’t touch the rest of the poster” exercise

Goal:

Lock SUBJECT + COMPOSITION + COLOR.

Use DALL·E’s Edit / mask tool to change only the aura behind/around the owl.

Step 1 – Base image (Data Owl + simple aura)

[COMPOSITION] clean corporate hero layout: data owl on the left third, space on the right for abstract “dashboard” shapes; medium shot from waist-up equivalent, plenty of white space and clear margins
[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed, clean geometric feathers, friendly but professional expression
[BACKGROUND] abstract interface area on the right: a tidy arrangement of panels and chart frames, simple line and bar shapes suggesting fintech dashboards, all subordinate to the owl

[STYLE] modern fintech corporate illustration: clean vector-like shapes, subtle geometry, professional and polished, no cartoon exaggeration, no painterly texture
[COLOR] use [FINTECH_PALETTE]
[VALUE DESIGN] owl and main foreground panel sit as darker mid-values; background panels are lighter mid-values; nothing in the background is as dark as the owl’s head and chest

[AURA] subtle circular data aura behind the owl’s head and shoulders, made of a soft ring and a few simple radial lines, very low contrast, using the same blues and teals from the fintech palette
[TEXTURE] flat digital surfaces, no grain or distress
[LIGHTING] soft, even lighting with minimal shading, just enough to separate layers; no dramatic glow
[MOOD] calm, trustworthy, data-driven

[NEGATIVE] no real company logos, no readable text or words, no watermark; no extra limbs; no realistic photography; no heavy gradients; no cluttered background
[OUTPUT] widescreen hero ratio suitable for a financial technology website; must read clearly in grayscale

Keep the owl, layout, and dashboard exactly the same.
Only change the aura behind the owl’s head:

Keep the owl, layout, and dashboard exactly the same.
Only change the aura behind the owl’s head:
- replace it with a stronger circular halo in fintech blues and teal,
- keep it subordinate so the owl is still the main subject.
Do not change the owl’s colors, the background colors, or the global lighting; only modify the aura graphics inside the existing aura area.

---

Keep the owl character, composition, and dashboard panels identical.
Only update the aura behind the owl’s head:
turn it into a segmented “data ring” made of arcs, dashes, and small bars,
like a circular chart, in fintech blues and teal.
Keep it slightly softer than the owl’s silhouette so the owl is still the hero.
Change nothing else in the image.
