## 4A — Palette A + Texture 20%

>[COMPOSITION] clean corporate hero layout: data owl on the left third, space on the right for abstract “dashboard” shapes; medium shot from waist-up equivalent, plenty of white space and clear margins
[SUBJECT] stylized data owl analyst, upright, wearing a simple blazer-like chest panel, looking slightly toward the viewer, one wing resting on a rectangular data panel, the other wing relaxed, clean geometric feathers, friendly but professional expression
[BACKGROUND] abstract interface area on the right: a tidy arrangement of panels and chart frames, simple line and bar shapes suggesting fintech dashboards, all subordinate to the owl

[AURA] keep the aura area and size identical; use a segmented “data ring” made of arcs, dashes, and small bars in fintech blues and teal; keep it slightly softer than the owl’s silhouette so the owl remains the hero

[STYLE] modern fintech corporate illustration: clean vector-like shapes, subtle geometry, professional and polished, no cartoon exaggeration, no painterly texture
[COLOR] use [PALETTE_A_FINTECH]
[TEXTURE] subtle soft gradients at ~20% strength inside panels and the owl’s chest piece only; no grain, no distress
[LIGHTING] soft, even lighting with minimal shading, just enough to separate layers; no dramatic glow

[NEGATIVE] no real company logos, no readable text or words, no watermark; no extra limbs; no realistic photography; no heavy gradients; no cluttered background
[OUTPUT] widescreen hero ratio suitable for a financial technology website; must read clearly in grayscale
